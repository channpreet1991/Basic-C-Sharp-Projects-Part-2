There are some small projects i made using c# and .net framework.

Projects:
1. Console Application
2. Blackjack Game

CONSOLE APP
In the context of C#, a console application takes input and displays output at a command-line console with access to three primary data streams: standard input, standard output, and standard error.
A console application facilitates the reading and writing of characters from a console - either individually or as an entire line. The simplest form of a C# program is typically invoked from the Windows command prompt. A console application usually exists in the form of a stand-alone executable file with minimal or no graphical user interface (GUI). In the c# level 2 course, we created a console app that includes: operator overloading, generics, enums, structs, etc.


BLACKJACK
You must collect more cards than the dealer without going over 21 points if you want to win at blackjack. You are awarded a face value for each card of rank two through ten.
